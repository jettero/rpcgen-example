I wanted to know how this antiquated purposeless thingy worked. I started
up a glusterd which started or required an rpcbind portmapper service.
Then I noticed rpcinfo and started to wonder how you write services for the
portmapper. Traditionally, apparently, people started with rpcgen.

I suspect it's too antiquated to actually use, but I enjoyed making this
Makefile(s). Note: I enjoy making Makefiles. rpcgen can generate a Makefile
too -- that's probably the smarter choice if you really mean to use rpcgen
for some reason.

Other notes:

- pacman -S rpcsvc-proto tirpc

- the generated code doesn't actually do anything except binding to the
  portmapper and portmapping â€¦

  - make IDL_server
  - the program ID (456123789) is hardcoded in IDL.x along with the version (6)
  - ./IDL_server & sleep 1 & rpcinfo -s | grep 456123789
  - killall IDL_server

- I suspect this isn't directly related to the way (eg) glusterfs does
  things ... but perhaps it's closer than I think. It does seem to need
  rpcbind.
